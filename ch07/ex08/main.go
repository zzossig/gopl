/*
	Many GUIs provide a table widget with a stateful multi-tier sort:
	the primary sort key is the most recently clicked column head,
	the secondary sort key is the second-most recently clicked column head, and so on.
	Define an implementation of `sort.Interface` for use by such a table.
	Compare that approach with repeated sorting using `sort.Stable`.
